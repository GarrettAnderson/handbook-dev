# Handbook Development

A little dev tool for previewing changes the SDG handbook.

## Setup

This is a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)-based project.

Handbook content is expected to be cloned along side this repo, i.e.:

```
.
├── handbook
├── handbook-dev
```

`handbook` would be _your fork_ of the [Handbook Repo](https://github.com/suncoast-devs/handbook).

After cloning both repos:

```
cd handbook-dev
npm install
npm start
```

Then start hacking on markdown files in the `handbook` directory.
